# About

Besides this readme file and the license, I didn't directly write any code. I used bolt.new to generate the code for the project. It took about 10 iterations of my feedback and testing to get it to it's current state.

I ran out of bolt.new tokens and started using GitHub Copilot Workspace to continue the development.

Copilot workspace was down, so I used Github Copilot in VSCode to generate the code for this feature.
