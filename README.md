# About

Besides this readme file and the license, I didn't directly write any code. I used bolt.new to generate the code for the project. It took about 10 iterations of my feedback and testing to get it to it's current state.

I ran out of bolt.new tokens and started using GitHub Copilot Workspace to continue the development.

## Banner

A banner has been added at the bottom of the app that says, "built with bolt.new and copilot workspace" with the correct images and links.
